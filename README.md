##### Candidate: Mario Leonardo Salinas Supervisor: Prof. Paolo Cignoni

The [thesis](main.pdf) is about a visualization platform which facilitates the selection of reviewers. The platform, ReviewerNet.org, is demonstrated in the field of Computer Graphics and it's publicly available at [this link](http://reviewernet.org). 

It builds on a reference database including papers, authors and citations from selected sources (journal articles and conference papers) taken from the Semantic Scholar Research Corpus. ReviewerNet can be built over any dataset, according to the domain of interest.
